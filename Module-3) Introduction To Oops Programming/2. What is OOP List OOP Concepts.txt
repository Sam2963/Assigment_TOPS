2. What is OOP? List OOP Concepts
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP allows developers to create modular, reusable, and more maintainable code.

Core OOP Concepts:
Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
Object: An instance of a class.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to them.
Inheritance: A way for a new class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (parent).
Polymorphism: The ability to use the same function name for different types or behaviors.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features to the user.
