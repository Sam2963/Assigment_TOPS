3. Difference between OOP and POP
Difference between OOP and POP

Aspect              OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)      POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach            Focuses on objects and classes         Focuses on functions and procedures
Modularity          Code is divided into objects           Code is divided into functions
Data Security       Encapsulation ensures restricted       No data hiding; functions share 
                    access                                 global data
Code Reusability    Promotes reusability through           Reusability is limited to functions
                    inheritance
Examples            C++, Java, Python                      C, Fortran, Pascal
