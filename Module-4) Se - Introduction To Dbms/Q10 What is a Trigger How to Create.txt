Q10 What is a Trigger? How to Create a Trigger?
A trigger is a set of SQL commands that execute automatically in response to an event (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on a table.
Example Trigger:

CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO EmployeeLogs (EmployeeID, Action) 
    VALUES (NEW.EmployeeID, 'Inserted');
END;
